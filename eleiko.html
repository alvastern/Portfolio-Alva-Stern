          <p>In this design studio, my group was given a brief by Eleiko. The group reviewed the brief 
            and identified the problems, design-requirements, challenges, and the goal. The task was to design a service where 
            Eleikos customers would be able to rent training equipment and at the same time provide 
            Eleiko with knowledge about how the equipment is being used. We were also going to explore 
            the opportunities for a circular business model for Eleiko, they wanted to be able to 
            control the circularity of the equipment since they work with sustainability. </p>

              <p><b>Domain knowledge, desktop research and brief</b></p>
              <p>The project group started by analyzing the assigned brief, conducting desktop research 
                and gaining domain knowledge. The purpose of conducting desktop research was to establish 
                a solid foundation of knowledge and insights to guide our decisions throughout the 
                project.</p>

              <p><b>Current state analysis</b></p>
              <p>To identify where Eleiko stands today, the project group conducted a current state 
                analysis. Analyses like a SWOT-analysis and a sustainable analysis was conducted to 
                make us understand which strengths, weakness and opportunities Eleiko had in the 
                beginning of the project. This helped us understand what Eleiko needed to change to be 
                able to go from a linear to a circular business model.</p>

            <p id="rubrikresearcheleiko"><b>2. Research</b></p>
            <p><b>Interview guide</b></p>
            <p>Before conducting the interviews, we created an interview guide. When designing our 
              guide, we focused primarily on how stakeholders acquired Eleiko's training equipment. 
              We were interested in understanding their previous purchasing process to gain greater 
              insight into the current procedure for purchasing equipment from Eleiko. This approach 
              allowed us to identify pain points from the customer’s perspective and to develop a 
              comprehensive view of the process. </p>

            <p><b>Conduct interviews</b></p>
            <p>To reach our identified target group (companies, hotels, and property owners) we began 
              by researching online to find various facilities, hotels, and properties that currently 
              have a gym or have previously purchased equipment from Eleiko. We conducted six interviews 
              with the identified target group and recorded them because we didn't want to lose any 
              important information.</p>

            <p><b>Compile data</b></p>
            <div id="displaycompiledataeleiko">
              <p>We transcribed the recordings and documented quotes (SK), key observations (BW), and 
                summarized quotes (CK), ensuring we captured all data relevant to coding. Coding our 
                data allowed us to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior and expectations, 
                helping us understand customer needs and preferences. We decided to create a 
                visualization of the identified themes and categories.</p>

                  We identified relevant stakeholders by creating a stakeholder map. The stakeholder map 
                  helped us understand which actors Eleiko currently collaborates with, as well as other 
                  parties that could be important for Eleiko’s future network. The purpose of this map was 
                  to analyze Eleiko’s network structure and assess its potential for expansion through the 
                  implementation of a rental service. </p>

              <p id="customerjourneymaptexteleiko">Based on the data, we developed a customer journey map to visualize the customer’s 
                experience with Eleiko's current purchasing process. The map includes a scenario that 
                follows the customer’s experience and illustrates the customer’s emotions and 
                experience. To address pain points, we documented potential 
                opportunities for improvement.</p>

            <p id="rubrikCSMeleiko"><b>Concept definition methods</b></p>
            <p>To generate concept ideas, we used the brainstorming method brainwriting 6-3-5. With a 
              large number of ideas generated, we conducted an idea evaluation. This was done by having 
              each team member vote on every idea using a color dot system. Then, context scenarios were 
              developed. Each team member wrote down a scenario of a concept to get the ideas down on 
              paper and therefore make the ideas more clear. We created storyboards to visualize these 
              concepts. By visualizing each concept, we were able to filter out ideas that might not 
              align with Eleiko’s or their customers' vision, or work in practice.</p>

                services positively would transform the purchasing process for Eleiko's customers.</p>

            <p>Once our two services were finalized, we created two service blueprints to map out the 
              logistics of each service. The purpose of this was to visualize Eleiko's logistics and to 
              outline the mandatory steps that both the customers and Eleiko would need to follow for 
              these services to work in practice.</p>

            <p id="rubrikSAASeleiko"><b>Strength as a Service</b></p>
            <p>The concept strength as a service is a rental service that ensures Eleiko receives a 
              steady inflow of products, thereby enabling a circular business model. Eleiko will rent 
              or lease out new equipment in the beginning to start the flow of products, then they will 
              have the opportunity to offer different packages, new, mixed, or used products. By 
              offering used products can attract more customers since, based on our research, many 
              customers thinks it’s too expensive.</p>

              <p>A service agreement will be included in the renting or leasing. This means Eleiko will 
                provide regular maintenance or repair damage as needed. Each product will have a product 
                ID connected to a central database, allowing Eleiko to track and maintain control over 
                its products.</p>
              
              <p>The rental contract will remain binding as long as the customer wishes to continue 
                renting. When the leasing contract expires, the customer will have the option to either 
                return the products or purchase the products from Eleiko.</p>

                circular business model?</b></p>
                <p>The concept attracts new customer groups who are not willing to make large investments in a gym.</p>
                <p>The concept ensures a steady inflow of products.</p>
                <p>In the long term, the concept can offer various equipment packages, including used products.</p>

          <div id="eleikocollectdesignsolutions">
            <p id="rubrikECeleiko"><b>EleikoCollect</b></p>
            <p>EleikoCollect is a service encouraging companies that have gym equipment from Eleiko, to 
              return the equipment to Eleiko in exchange for compensation. This allows Eleiko to regain 
              control over its used equipment, enhancing product circularity and fostering a circular 
              business model. Eleiko will offer a service where customer can have their current gym 
              dismantled and, if desired, a new gym installed at the same time. Through this, customers 
              who have purchased or are purchasing equipment from Eleiko, may be more happy to return 
              the equipment. Customers with unused or stored Eleiko gym equipment can utilize 
              EleikoCollect without needing to buy new equipment. Instead, they can have the equipment 
              collected at no cost and receive a voucher for future use, in exchange for Eleiko 
              reclaiming the equipment.</p>

            <p>Information about the service will be available on Eleiko's website. Customers with a 
              business account will be able to apprise their current equipment though Eleikos website 
              by input details about the type of equipment and its duration of use. Once the appraisal 
              is completed, the customer will receive an estimated value for their equipment. Customers 
              are more likely to return equipment to Eleiko when they know the approximate value they 
              will receive for their equipment.</p>

              <p>The concept promotes a circular business model.</p>
              <p>The concept allows Eleiko to potentially offer rental, leasing, or sales of used equipment in the future.</p>
