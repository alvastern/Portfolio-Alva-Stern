              <p>In this project, me and my project group collaborated with Eleiko, where the task was to design a service where 
                Eleikos customers would be able to rent training equipment and at the same time, provide Eleiko with knowledge 
                about how the equipment is being used. The goal was also to explore the opportunities for a circular business 
                model for Eleiko, where they wanted to go from a linear to circular business model and be able to control the 
                circularity of their equipment.</p>

                  needed to be developed, and what may make the customers consider to not get a gym. I then conducted several

                  This supports Eleiko’s circular business model by reclaiming and reusing equipment. Customers with a business 
                  account can have their equipment valued via Eleiko’s website. After valuation, they receive an estimated 
                  value and can have their gym dismantled and, if desired, replaced with new equipment.<br>

            <li><b>Design isn’t always about details:</b> I learned that design could be about designing

            <li><b>Design for the project owner:</b> I learned that I have to adapt my design

            <li><b>Conversations instead of interviews:</b> Service design is about creating

            <li><b>Adapt design process:</b> I learned that the design process needs to be adapted to the project.</li>

            <li><b>Data from interviews:</b> I learned that it’s essential to define the data to be gathered before interviews.</li>

            <li><b>Preparatory work & domain knowledge:</b> I realized preparatory work and domain knowledge
