                <p class="textvolvo">Two separate interfaces were designed, one for car owners and one for lenders. Features like history and car-sharing are not included 
                  for lenders. Users who lend cars mentioned that they don't want to create an account.</p>

                <p class="textvolvo">Research showed that the app should work as a traditional car key. The buttons in the app were placed similarly to a car key. Users can 
                  lock, unlock, and open the trunk in the app. Users should not lose any functions.</p>

                <p class="title"><b>Menu</b></p>
                <p class="textvolvo">We chose to create a side menu for the app. The functions did not become too deep and the information architecture became logical, based on 
                  user evaluations. The side menu opens up possibilities for future development.</p>

                <p class="textvolvo">The history features of the application are, seeing who has used the car most, viewing where the car was last 
                  parked, adjust lend times and indefinite lends and the option to cancel or extend a sharing arrangement.</p>

                <p class="textvolvo">To ensure high security, we implemented Face-ID for critical actions like locking, unlocking and sharing. Face-ID can’t be turned off 
                  since it provides security. If Face-ID isn’t used or doesn’t work, the phone's pin-code can be entered.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Communication with the project owner:</b> I learned about the importance of having good a 
                communication with the project owner.</li>

              <li><b>Motivate all design choices:</b> I realized that I always will have to be able to 
                motivate all design choices based on research.</li>
                
              <li><b>Information architecture:</b> I learned about the importance of information 
                architecture. It determines the flow in the application and therefore, the usability.</li>
                
              <li><b>Design for users:</b> I realized that it’s important to design for the users and not for anyone else.</li>
                
              <li><b>Iteration & Evaluations:</b> I noticed the value of iteration and evaluations. Data from evaluations 
                can easily help to iterate prototypes and make them more user-friendly.</li>
                
              <li><b>Iterate interview guides:</b> I learned that it’s a normal to iterate interview-guides, since interviews create 
                new knowledge in turn which could generate more questions.</li>
