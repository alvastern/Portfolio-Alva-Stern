            <p>In this design studio, my group was given a brief by Volvo Cars. The group reviewed the brief 
              and identified design problems, design-requirements, challenges and the goal of the project. 
              The task was to design and prototype a digital interface for an app that supports locking and unlocking 
              a car from a mobile app. The task was also to base the content in the app on research and the given design-requirements.</p>

              <p id="PSPWABvolvo"><b>1. Preliminary Studies, Preparatory work & Analyzing Brief</b></p>
              <p>The project group began by analyzing the assigned brief, conducting desktop research and gaining 
                domain knowledge. We reviewed existing apps for locking and unlocking cars to understand which 
                features are commonly included and how these apps present their functions. By doing this, we were 
                able to identify our target audience. The target group we identified is car owners and people with 
                driver licenses without a car, who’re open to lend cars.</p>
             </div>

              <p id="rubrikresearchvolvo"><b>2. Research</b></p>
              <p><b>Interviews</b></p>
              <p class="mellanrum">We contacted several car owners and people with driver licenses without cars, and scheduled 
                interviews. Two semi-structured interview guides was created, one for car owners and one for people 
                with driver licenses. We recorded the interviews so that we could revisit them later to ensure we 
                captured all information. After each interview, the project team discussed whether we were satisfied 
                with the responses or if we needed to adjust the interview guide.</p>

              <p><b>Compile Interview Results</b></p>
              <p>After each interview, the recorded material was transcribed. We compiled the interviews into an 
                affinity diagram, where we created categories. The categories and material was sorted based on the 
                questions asked during the interviews.</p>

                <h3 id="volvoresearchsummary">Research Summary</h3>
                <p><b>Contact Information:</b> The owner wants access to the lenders phone number or SMS contact.</p>

                <p><b>Mileage:</b> Feature that shows how far the car has been driven when it was lent out.</p>
                  
                <p><b>Time Limit:</b> A person should be allowed to lend the car for a maximum of two days.</p>
                  
                <p><b>Lending to family and friends:</b> The car owner prefers to lend the car to family, friends, and 
                  in some cases, coworkers.</p>
                  
                <p><b>Other lenders:</b> The owner may consider lending the car to strangers under special 
                  circumstances.</p>
                  
                <p><b>Required information:</b> Name and phone number for people they trust. Address, drivers 
                  license and personal number for strangers.</p>
                  
                <p><b>Lending history:</b> Useful if the owner lends to many people or strangers. For 
                  lends to family and friends, this is less important.</p>
                  
                <p><b>GDPR compliance:</b> The car owner should follow GDPR regulations when handling personal data.</p>
                  
                <p><b>Key functionality:</b> The app should be as convenient as using a physical car key with a 
                  locking/unlocking function.</p>

              <p><b>Sketches</b></p>
              <p>The project team started to sketch the key features. The purpose of the sketching phase 
                was to consolidate the group's various visions of the concept. These visions were based on the compiled 
                responses from the interviews. We conducted a braindrawing session to generate multiple sketches that
                 could later be developed further.</p>

               <p id="wireframesmellanrum"><b>Wireframes</b></p>
               <p id="firstwireframes">Wireframes were used to develop design solutions and allow iteration. This approach helped us 
                avoid focusing on a final prototype before ensuring the design decisions were user-friendly. We 
                developed wireframes in low and mid-fidelity to begin with. The wireframes were iterated several 
                times to ensure that all features were incorporated and that the information architecture 
                was logical.</p>

                <p><b>Method</b></p>
                <p>To accomplish an effective idea generation, we used a brainstorming method. This method helped 
                  us to think outside the box and therefore come with new and innovative ideas. The brainstorming 
                  method we used is called brainwriting 6-3-5.</p>

             <div id="prototypingvolvo">
              <p id="prototypingrubrikvolvo"><b>4. Prototyping</b></p>
              <p>After the idea generation, we created a fully functional prototype for us to use during the 
                evaluations. The prototype wasn’t fully developed to high-fidelity, since we wanted our test-persons 
                to focus on the features and information architecture in the prototype instead of visual things.</p>
             </div>

             <div id="evaluationsvolvo">
              <p id="evaluationrubrikvolvo"><b>5. Evaluations & Iterations</b></p>

              <p><b>Evaluations</b></p>
              <p>During the design process, we conducted evaluations in the form of usability tests to ensure the 
                interface was understandable for users. We reached out to several users and scheduled evaluation 
                sessions. Special tasks were identified for the users to complete during the usability tests. These 
                tasks were focused on parts of the prototype that we were uncertain about in terms of ease of 
                navigation and understanding. We prepared a set of questions to ask the participants after the 
                usability test to gather insights on aspects of the prototype.</p>

              <p><b>Iterations</b></p>
              <p>Based on the feedback we received during evaluations, we iterated our prototype. Whenever we 
                discovered that something in the prototype lacked, we revised it according to the feedback to ensure 
                the prototype was user-friendly. These iterations were crucial to our final product, as we revised it 
                several times before finalizing it, resulting in the best possible version of the prototype. 
                Below is an example:</p>

            <div id="finalprototypevolvo">
              <p id="FPrubrikvolvo"><b>6. Final Prototype</b></p>
              <p>After we could ensure usability in the prototype through evaluations, we created the final 
                high-fidelity prototype. The prototype was based on the completed wireframes. We added interactions 
                to the prototype to make it as realistic as possible, allowing Volvo to gain a clear understanding 
                of how the app's flow works and to see a clear picture of our results.</p>
